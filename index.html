  <div><h2>GAIA</h2>
  <p>GAIA helps highlights global environmental issues that pose an immediate threat or danger to ecosystems throughout the world and suggest solutions or courses of action by the general public as well as companies and governments.</p>
    <p>GAIA aims to power a transition away from our current linear and extractive economy and towards a circular system that supports people’s right to a safe and healthy environment. This entails fighting pollution and building regenerative solutions in cities through local campaigns, shifts in policy and finance, research and communication initiatives, and movement building. We work on four primary points of intervention: incineration, zero waste, plastic, and climate.</p></div>
  <div><p>GAIA’s leadership and organizational structure are designed to facilitate building movement power and capacity, support work driven by the needs of our grassroots membership, and advance strategic cross-border campaigns and movement building. Our trans-local organizing model respects place-based leadership, fosters solidarity, and identifies points of common cause.</p><p>
    Our leadership model directly reflects our work on the ground, with transparency, accountability, and horizontal alignment being our main motivators. GAIA’s diverse leadership team implements a distributed leadership model across our organization representing our five regions of work (Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America & the Caribbean, United States & Canada).</p><img src="Climate.jpg"></div></main>
