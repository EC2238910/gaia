<h2>Seas</h2>
<p >Seas are bodies of saltwater that are partially enclosed by land. They play a crucial role in the Earth's ecosystem, providing habitats for a wide variety of marine life. Seas also serve as important transportation routes and contribute to climate regulation. However, seas face numerous environmental threats, such as pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction, which require conservation efforts to protect their delicate balance.</p></div>

<h2>Pollution and Overfishing</h2>
<p >Sea pollution refers to the contamination of the ocean with harmful substances such as chemicals, plastics, and oil spills. This pollution has significant impacts on marine life, ecosystems, and ultimately, the health of our planet. It is important to address and reduce sea pollution through sustainable practices and awareness.</p>
<p>Overfishing is the act of fishing beyond the sustainable levels, resulting in depletion of fish populations and disruption of marine ecosystems. It is a serious issue that can lead to the collapse of fisheries and loss of livelihoods for communities dependent on fishing. Overfishing can be mitigated through proper fisheries management, including setting catch limits, implementing fishing quotas, and promoting sustainable fishing practices.</p>
